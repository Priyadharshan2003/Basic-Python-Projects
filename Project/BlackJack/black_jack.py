BlackJack is very popular card game mainly played in casinos around the world.
Let's imagine this program as a virtual casino with computer as the Dealer.
The purpose of this game is to beat the Dealer, which can be done in various ways.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Both the player and the dealer are given 2 cards at the beginning , but one of the dealer's card is kept hidden.

Each card holds a certain value. 
Numbered cards contain value identical to their number.
All face cards hold a value of 10
Ace can either hold a value of 1 or 11 depending on the situation.

BlackJack means 21. Whoever gets a total value of 21 with their cards immediately wins!
(winning through blackjack results in 3x the money)
If the value of cards goes over 21, its called a BUST, which results in immediate loss...
If both the players get the same value of cards , it's a TIE and the bet money is returned.

If none of the above cases are met ,the person with closer value to 21 wins.
(winning like this returns 2x the bet money)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Let the game begin!"""
